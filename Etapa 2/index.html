                <b>The parachute</b> is an adjustable device designed to slow down the movement of a body through the atmosphere using air friction.
                Parachutes are usually used to slow down a person or object from falling through the air until
                the speed of descent no longer endangers the life of that person or the integrity of the object. Also parachutes
                are used to slow down the horizontal movement of a vehicle (aircraft or space shuttle) on landing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Skydiving</b> is part of the category of dangerous sports, for the practice of which it is necessary to obtain
                a patent, following courses on theoretical and practical training. Even folding a parachute requires assimilation
                knowledge. Faulty folding, but also incorrect handling during the fall, can lead to accidents,
                often fatal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The first account of a parachute</b> dates from 2258-2208 BC, when, in a Chinese manuscript,
                the escape of Sun, the emperor of China, from a high tower with the help of two parachutes, with which
                it reaches the ground easily without injury. Therefore, Emperor Sun can be considered the first parachutist in history.

            <h2>The first parachutes in Romania</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The first classic parachutes appeared in Romania were made in France.
                With these parachutes, four Romanian aviators were saved in 1917: Bădărău, Secărescu, Mihalcea and Kally.
                Many Romanian inventors thought of building their own parachute. The first was Marcel T.D.
                Juvara, in 1916, then Grigorescu and Sziklay Ioan, in 1923. But the Romanian aviation was eventually equipped with German parachutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until 1931 the history of parachutes is related to the flight of airplanes: aviators are often saved
                parachuting from endangered planes or falling victim to weather parachutes. This is how it is saved
                Captain Gheorghe Banciulescu, who would later become the first aviator to fly a plane
                prostheses on both legs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1931 the parachute began to be used in sports launches by Smaranda Brăescu,
                who becomes the first person in the history of Romanian skydiving to set a world record for skydiving.
                On October 2, 1931 Smaranda Brăescu jumps from 6000 meters altitude, near Slobozia, in Bărăgan, with immediate opening,
                and breaks the women's world record for height, which was held by the American parachutist Smith. Six months later, on May 19, 1932,
                 in Sacramento, Smaranda Brăescu also broke the men's world record, setting a new absolute record of height, of 7233 meters.

            <p><strong>Atention!!</strong>Do not go skydiving if you have any <strong>severe medical problems.</strong></p>
            
            <h2 id = "tips_list">Safety Tips to keep in mind:</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>1.Get your Body Right!</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>You don’t need to be physically fit to go skydiving, but it can be really helpful to do a few warm up exercises and stretches 
                    to get your body and muscles feeling loose. Remember, you’ll be freefalling at more than 120mph (190kph), so it’s important that 
                    your body is completely relaxed while in the air. Do some jumping jacks or run in place on the morning of your jump; and don’t 
                    forget to do some simple stretches, especially for your neck . If you have any medical conditions, consult 
                    with your physician before attempting any skydive.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2. It’s All in the Mind</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>You’re jumping OUT of a plane! Okay, now that the elephant has been addressed, feel free to relax now. I know it’s easier said 
                    than done, but you’re paying for an unforgettable experience, so you should definitely enjoy every penny of it. It’s always a 
                    good idea to educate yourself on skydiving by watching videos or reading articles about it, but try not to focus and overreact 
                    to any negative headlines and psyche yourself out in the process (see point 5 below). If you still feel uneasy on the day of your 
                    jump, try some meditation to help rest and relax your emotions and steady your mind.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>3. Take it Easy and Breathe</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This may sound unusual, but knowing how to breathe correctly is important when you’re up in the air. Avoid hyperventilation by taking 
                    deep, slow breaths instead of short, quick successive breathes. Stay calm, relax and listen to your instructor who shall no doubt 
                    walk you through this like a pro; and if you feel the slightest bit uneasy, be sure to let him or her know about it. Despite what you 
                    may think, breathing is not difficult and should be able to breathe like normal, as if you were on the ground. If you do experience any 
                    difficulty in breathing, it’s probably because you’re head is tilted too low causing the wind to rush at your face and into your nose at
                     an odd angle. But there’s no need to panic, just tilt your head back, keep your eyes aimed towards the horizon and breathe through your 
                     mouth if necessary.</p>

                <h3>4. Be Like the Banana, My Friend</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip4.jpg" alt="">
                <p>As I was being fitted for my harness, my instructor calmly pointed to an adjacent wall, where a photo of a banana, juxtaposed next to a 
                    skydiver, could be found. “Today, my friend,” he coolly remarked. “You’re favorite fruit will be a banana.” In other words, your body 
                    should mimic the shape of a banana when you’re in mid-air, which means that your head should be tilted back, eyes looking straight ahead 
                    towards the horizon, back arched, arms comfortably extended to the sides, and legs relaxed with the soles of your feet aimed up towards the sky.</p>

                <h3>5. Don’t Believe the Hype!</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip5/jpg" alt="">
                <p>More than likely you’ll be jumping at around 13,000 feet (3,962 meters), and understandably it can look and feel terrifying to
                     peer through the airplane window to the ground below. But despite the sensational headlines you may have read, skydiving is actually 
                     very safe. According to the United States Parachute Association (USPA), out of the estimated 3.2 million annual skydive jumps that occurred 
                     in the United States in 2014, there have been 24 fatalities reported (that’s eight deaths per one million jumps).In other words, if you can 
                     accept the risk of driving your car to work every day or taking a flight to that long-awaited vacation spot, then why shouldn’t you go skydiving?</p>

                <h3>6. Enjoy the Morbid (and Hilarious) Sense of Humor of Skydivers</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip6.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <q>What’s the hardest part about skydiving? (The ground.)</q>
                <q>No one has ever complained of a parachute not opening.</q>
                <q>You don’t need a parachute to skydive. You need a parachute to skydive twice. </q> 
                <p>You know, there’s something oddly reassuring about a group of skydivers who are only half-joking about death. But, to be honest, I feel that’s
                     a good thing, since I’m sure many first-time jumpers will naturally feel a tinge of anxiety before a jump. And there’s no better way to offset
                      the potential angst of a nerve-wracking experience than with a healthy dose of laughter.</p>

                <h3>7. Safety is Paramount</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip7.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Don’t ever mistake the relaxed personality of your instructor or his slew of witty jokes (though you should admit it’s a great ice breaker) 
                    as a sign of carelessness, because safety is absolutely paramount above all else. These guys and girls are consummate professionals who do 
                    this as their JOB every single day (In fact, my instructor was scheduled to do seven jumps that day!) All skydiving instructors must be certified
                     with a class D license and have completed at least 500 total jumps. Go online and check to see if the credentials of your skydiving company and 
                     instructor are properly certified.</p>

                <h3>8. What to Bring</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Wear loose, but comfortable clothing, such as a T-shirt, pants and sneakers. It may feel a slight chilly up there but when you leap out of 
                    the plane your adrenaline will no doubt kick in and the cold won’t affect you, so a jacket or hoodie won’t be necessary. Bring cash 
                    to buy some food or drink, photo/video package (you’ll definitely want to remember you’re first jump with a video, trust me), and some
                     money to leave a tip for your instructor. The earlier in the day you arrive the less time you’ll need to wait around, but feel free to bring 
                     some playing cards or chat with your fellow skydivers to occupy your time.</p>

                <h3>9. How Does it Really Feel to Fall Through the Sky?</h3>
                <img src="Poze/tip9.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Absolutely amazing! That’s the short answer, but nothing can quite prepare you for the moment when you finally muster the courage to peer 
                    over edge of the opened fuselage door, leap out of a plane at 13,000 feet and free fall at more than 120mph through the sky. It’s 
                    terrifying yet exciting at the same time, especially knowing that the only thing stopping you from attempting a second jump is the singular 
                    hope that your instructor properly packed your parachute that morning (by the way, all instructors, and obviously mine included, are required 
                    to inspect each pack before going up).</p>
                <p>For those brief 60 seconds that you’re in free fall, it oddly feels that you’re suspended in mid-air because there’s nothing in your
                     immediate surroundings to help properly gauge just how fast you’re truly falling. It almost feels like you’ve fallen in a gigantic pool 
                     of quicksand, filled only with high-speed wind and slowly sinking towards the ground (albeit at 176 feet per second!).</p>

            <h3>Most asked questions:</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>Is tandem skydiving safe?</summary>
                <p>Skydiving is an extreme sport – with it comes some level of risk, so there are no guarantees. However the entire sport of skydiving is centered 
                    around safety and takes safety into consideration first and foremost.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What is physically required to tandem skydive?</summary>
                <p>Although older age isn’t a factor, physical health is. After all – good physical health is a plus in any sport. If you are taking prescription
                 drugs for an illness, you are required to have a doctor’s certificate stating that no adverse effects will result from you making a parachute jump. 
                Over the years, we’ve even introduced tandem skydiving to paraplegic and quadriplegic students, so the limits might surprise you. Not sure? Call and ask!</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Will I get that falling feeling? Or that “stomach drop” feeling?</summary>
                <p>There is no sudden drop feeling associated with freefall. The feeling is not what you would expect — it’s not like on a roller coaster. Since the plane 
                you are in is moving forward in excess of 100mph, the 
                horizontal movement of the plane creates a cushion of air when you jump out that supports your body and makes it feel like you are flying (as opposed to falling).</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can I eat or drink anything before skydiving?</summary>
                <p>Light meals are recommended before your skydive! Try to avoid a lot of caffeine. People under the influence of alcohol or drugs will not be allowed to jump.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if the parachute doesn’t open?</summary>
                <p>This is definitely one of the most common questions that we hear quite often! Overall, it is extremely rare that a parachute has a malfunction of some kind. 
                As we’ve mentioned, the sport of skydiving is centered around safety. Per the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), all skydiving parachute rigs are 
                equipped with a main parachute (primary chute) and a reserve parachute (secondary chute). There is also a device in the parachute container called an 
                Automatic Activation Device (AAD) which is designed to deploy the reserve parachute if it senses a skydiver(s) is still in freefall at a certain altitude. 
                All parachutes are packed and maintained according to the standards of the FAA and parachute manufacturers.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are there weight restrictions to tandem skydive? Why?</summary>
                <p>There are certain restrictions for guests that weigh over 200 lbs. There are several factors taken into consideration in this instance. Most notably, 
                the equipment manufacturer defines the limits for the gear use, which includes the total weight of the tandem pair. Also depending on wind conditions, 
                we need to ensure the instructor you are paired with is set up to land the tandem canopy safely.</p>
